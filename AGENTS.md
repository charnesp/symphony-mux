# Using Superpowers

**ALWAYS invoke the `using-superpowers` skill before any response or action.**

Even if the user's request seems simple, invoke this skill first to establish proper workflow discipline:

```
Skill: using-superpowers
```

This skill determines HOW to approach every task and ensures you:
- Check for relevant skills before acting
- Follow the correct OpenSpec workflow (explore → propose → apply → archive)
- Never rationalize your way out of using skills

# Project Overview

**Stokowski** is a Python daemon that orchestrates autonomous coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Mux) driven by Linear issues. It implements a configurable state machine with **optional multi-workflow routing** (Linear labels), **human review gates**, and **`agent-gate`** states for machine-chosen transitions after one agent turn.

## Goals

- Enable unattended agent execution for Linear issues through configurable state machines
- Support **multiple workflows** in one config (`workflows:` + label / default routing)
- Support **agent-gate** machine routing from structured output, with safe fallback to a human gate
- Provide clean separation between interactive Claude Code usage and autonomous agent workflows
- Support human-in-the-loop review gates with approve/rework transitions
- Offer real-time monitoring via terminal UI and optional web dashboard

## Technology Choices

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Async Framework**: asyncio
- **HTTP Client**: httpx (for Linear GraphQL API)
- **CLI UI**: rich (terminal dashboard)
- **Templating**: jinja2 (for prompt assembly)
- **Web Dashboard**: FastAPI + uvicorn (optional)
- **External Dependencies**: Claude Code CLI, Codex CLI, or Mux (`runner: mux` per state)

## Architecture

The orchestrator runs a continuous poll loop:

1. **Fetch**: Query Linear for issues in active states
2. **Reconcile**: Cancel agents for issues that moved to terminal states
3. **Dispatch**: Spawn agent subprocesses for eligible issues
4. **Retry**: Schedule continuations or exponential backoff retries

Each issue gets an isolated workspace directory. Agents run via `claude -p` subprocess with NDJSON output streaming.

# Essential Commands

## Development Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Patterns

## State Machine Configuration

Workflows are defined in `workflow.yaml` (not in this repo — operator creates it):

- **agent states**: Run the configured runner (`claude`, `codex`, or `mux`) with the stage prompt; on success follow `transitions.complete`
- **agent-gate states**: Same runner stack as `agent` for **one** turn; on success parse `<<<STOKOWSKI_ROUTE>>>` … `<<<END_STOKOWSKI_ROUTE>>>` for `{"transition":"<key>"}` and follow `transitions[key]`. Requires `default_transition` pointing to a key whose **target** is `type: gate`. On parse failure, post `route-error` and use `default_transition`. Implementation: `agent_gate_route.py` — routing text is taken from **decoded** `assistant` / `result` fields in stream-json, not from raw NDJSON substrings.
- **gate states**: Pause for human review via Linear state changes (`approve` / `rework_to`)
- **terminal states**: Issue complete, workspace cleaned up

## Multi-workflow configuration

When `workflows:` is present, each entry is a named workflow with `label` (Linear label, exact match), optional `default: true`, and its own `states` + `prompts`. **First matching label in YAML order wins**; if none match, the default workflow is used; if there is no default, dispatch fails. Without `workflows:`, root `states` + `prompts` form a single implicit default workflow (backward compatible).

Orchestrator resolves `WorkflowConfig` per issue via `ServiceConfig.get_workflow_for_issue()` (see `config.py`).

## Three-Layer Prompt Assembly

Every agent turn receives:

1. **Global prompt** (shared preamble from `prompts/global.md`)
2. **Stage prompt** (state-specific from `prompts/{state}.md`)
3. **Lifecycle injection** (auto-generated: issue metadata, transitions, recent comments)

## Workspace Hooks

Configure in `workflow.yaml`:

- `after_create`: Runs once when workspace is created (e.g., `git clone`)
- `before_run`: Runs before each agent turn (e.g., `git fetch && git rebase`)
- `before_remove`: Runs before workspace cleanup

## Crash Recovery

State is recovered by parsing structured HTML comments on Linear issues (see `tracking.py`):

- `<!-- stokowski:state {...} -->` — State entry tracking
- `<!-- stokowski:gate {...} -->` — Gate status tracking

Agent-gate routing failures also post `<!-- stokowski:route-error b64:... -->` (human-readable body + base64 JSON payload).

# Anti-Patterns

## Don't Use `tty.setraw`

Use `tty.setcbreak()` instead. `setraw` disables `OPOST` output processing and causes Rich log lines to render diagonally.

## Don't Forget `--verbose` with `stream-json`

Claude Code requires `--verbose` when using `--output-format stream-json`. Without it, the command errors.

## Don't Omit `title` in Minimal Issue Constructions

`Issue(title=...)` is a required field. Even minimal Issue constructors (in `fetch_issues_by_states` and reconciliation defaults) must pass `title=""`.

## Don't Use Linear `nodes(ids:)` Query

The Linear API doesn't support this. Use `issues(filter: { id: { in: $ids } })` instead.

## Don't Monkey-Patch Uvicorn Signal Handlers After `serve()`

Patch `server.install_signal_handlers = lambda: None` before calling `serve()`, otherwise uvicorn hijacks SIGINT.

# Code Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Type hints on all public functions
- Async/await for I/O operations
- Dataclasses for configuration (see `config.py`)

# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

This project follows **strict TDD** for all code changes. **NO EXCEPTIONS**.

## The Golden Rule

**NEVER write production code without a failing test first.**

If you write code before the test:
1. **STOP immediately**
2. **DELETE the code you wrote**
3. **Write the test first**
4. **Start over**

This applies to:
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring
- "Quick" changes
- "Just documentation" (test the examples)
- Emergency fixes (still need a test that reproduces the bug)

## RED → GREEN → REFACTOR

1. **RED**: Write a failing test that describes the desired behavior
   - Watch it fail for the right reason
   - If it passes, your test is wrong

2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
   - No elegance, no optimization, just make it green
   - Copy-paste is OK, dirty code is OK

3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up while keeping tests green
   - Now you can make it pretty
   - Now you can optimize
   - Tests give you safety

## The "I Already Wrote The Code" Problem

**You wrote code before the test?**

→ **DELETE IT.** All of it. No exceptions. No "I'll just keep this one part."

**But it's just a small change...**

→ **DELETE IT.** Write the test first.

**But I understand the problem better now...**

→ **DELETE IT.** Understanding doesn't replace the red-green-refactor discipline.

**But we're in a hurry...**

→ **DELETE IT.** TDD is faster in the long run. The "quick" way is the slow way.

## Test Coverage Requirements

Every code change must have:
1. **Unit tests** for the new behavior
2. **Integration tests** if it crosses component boundaries
3. **Error case tests** for failure modes

**Coverage is not optional.** No "I'll add tests later." Later never comes.

## When in Doubt: Test First

If you're unsure whether a change needs TDD:

→ **IT NEEDS TDD. STOP. WRITE THE TEST.**

Use the `test-driven-development` skill for complete methodology.

# OpenSpec Methodology

This project follows the **OpenSpec** methodology for all code changes (except light debugging).

## Workflow Overview

For complex requests or when requirements are unclear, start with exploration:

```
/openspec-explore ──► /openspec-propose ──► /openspec-apply-change ──► /openspec-archive-change
```

For straightforward changes, skip exploration:

```
/openspec-propose ──► /openspec-apply-change ──► /openspec-archive-change
```

## Available Skills

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `openspec-explore` | Think through ideas, investigate problems, clarify requirements before committing to a change |
| `openspec-propose` | Create a new change with complete artifacts (proposal, design, tasks) in one step |
| `openspec-apply-change` | Implement tasks from an existing change |
| `openspec-archive-change` | Finalize and archive a completed change |

## Prerequisite

The OpenSpec CLI must be installed to use these skills:

```bash
npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest
```

## Usage

### Starting a New Change

```
/openspec-propose add-feature-x
```

This creates:
- `openspec/changes/add-feature-x/proposal.md` — what & why
- `openspec/changes/add-feature-x/design.md` — how
- `openspec/changes/add-feature-x/tasks.md` — implementation steps

### Implementing

```
/openspec-apply-change add-feature-x
```

Implements tasks from the change, updating checkboxes as you go.

### Archiving

```
/openspec-archive-change add-feature-x
```

Moves the completed change to `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-add-feature-x/`.

## Rules

- **Always use OpenSpec** for feature work, refactoring, or architectural changes
- **Light debugging** may proceed without a formal change
- **Never implement directly** without going through the propose → apply workflow
- **Update artifacts** if implementation reveals design issues

## NEVER Bypass OpenSpec Skills

**This is absolute. No exceptions. No rationalizations.**

When an OpenSpec skill (`openspec-explore`, `openspec-propose`, `openspec-apply-change`, `openspec-archive-change`) applies to your task, you MUST use it. The skill's instructions override any default behavior, instinct, or "common sense" shortcut.

### What "Following the Skill" Means

1. **Read the skill completely** using the Skill tool - never assume you remember it
2. **Execute every step** exactly as the skill specifies
3. **Never improvise** - if the skill says "run X", you run X. Don't substitute with "similar" commands
4. **Never split execution** - complete the full workflow, don't partial-apply and "finish manually"

### Forbidden Actions

| Forbidden | Why | Correct Action |
|-----------|-----|----------------|
| Editing files directly instead of using `openspec-propose` | Bypasses artifact generation | Use the skill, let it create artifacts |
| Creating `proposal.md` manually | Skips skill validation & structure | Use `openspec-propose` to generate it |
| Implementing code before `openspec-apply-change` | Skips task tracking & verification | Wait for the apply phase |
| "I'll just do this one thing first" | Rationalization that leads to bypass | Stop. Use the skill. |

### The Golden Rule

**When in doubt about whether to use an OpenSpec skill: USE IT.**

Better to over-follow a process than to bypass it. If the skill turns out to be unnecessary, that's a minor inefficiency. If you bypass a necessary skill, that's a process violation that corrupts the workflow state.

# Commit and Pull Request Guidelines

## Commit Message Format

Use release commits for versioning:

```
Release vX.Y.Z
```

For regular commits, use:

```
type: description

[optional body]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

## Release Process

1. Create a release PR with title `Release vX.Y.Z`
2. Merge to `main`
3. The release workflow automatically:
   - Detects the release commit pattern
   - Creates a GitHub tag
   - Creates a GitHub release with PR body as notes

## Validation Before Committing

- Test against a real Linear project with a test ticket
- Run `uv run stokowski .stokowski/workflow.yaml --dry-run` to validate the operator workflow config used in this repo
- Verify no breaking changes to state machine protocol
- Run `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` and ensure **all** hooks pass
- Validate `commit-msg` explicitly using the real subject you plan to commit (including release commits), e.g. `printf "<planned-subject>\n\n<optional-body>\n" > /tmp/commit-msg.txt && uv run pre-commit run --hook-stage commit-msg commitizen --commit-msg-filename /tmp/commit-msg.txt`
- **ABSOLUTE RULE:** do not commit, push, or open/update a PR while any pre-commit or commit-msg hook is failing

## Pull Request Requirements

- Describe the change and its motivation
- Note any breaking changes to config format or protocols
- Test against real Linear integration when possible
